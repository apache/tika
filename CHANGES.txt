Release 1.23 - 12/02/2019

   * NOTE: The PDFParser now relies on OCRDPI to render page images when
     users configure OCR on rendered page images. This will have the effect
     of increasing rendered image size (TIKA-2624).

   * NOTE: tika-server no longer returns 415 for file types for which there
     is no parser.

   * Fix bug in AUTO OCR strategy in the PDFParser (TIKA-3002).

   * Fix deadlock with ForkParser when InputStream throws IOException (TIKA-2892).

Release 1.22 - 07/29/2019

   * NOTE: tika-server no longer hard-codes the HtmlParser to handle
     XML files (TIKA-2910).  Users must now configure that behavior
     via a tika-config.xml file.

   * NOTE: Known regression: PDFBOX-4587 -- PDF passwords with codepoints
     between 0xF000 and 0XF0000 will cause an exception.

   * Add parser for HWP v5 files via SooMyung Lee (soomyung) and
     JinSup Kim (ddoleye) (TIKA-2909).

   * Fix order of closing streams to avoid "Failed to close temporary resource"
     exception in TesseractOCRParser (TIKA-2908).

   * Improve AutoDetectReader performance by caching encoding
     detector (TIKA-1568).

   * Prevent RTFParser from outputting illegal tag combinations (TIKA-2889).

   * Fix RereadableInputStream to release all resources (TIKA-2903).

   * Improve StreamingZipContainerDetector for xltx, xltm and
     several other file formats (TIKA-2886).

Release 1.21 - 05/14/2019

   * Add optional AUTO mode to OCR'ing of PDFs.  If tesseract is installed
     and on the path, and this option is selected programmatically
     or via TikaConfig(), the PDFParser will use heuristics to decide
     whether or not to run OCR per page on PDFs. (TIKA-2749)

   * The ZipContainerDetector's default behavior was changed to run
     streaming detection up to its markLimit.  Users can get the
     legacy behavior (spool-to-file/rely-on-underlying-file-in-TikaInputStream)
     by setting markLimit=-1. The POIFSContainerDetector requires an underlying file;
     it will try to spool the file to disk; if the file's length is > markLimit,
     it will not attempt detection; set markLimit to -1 for legacy behavior (TIKA-2849).

   * Upgrade PDFBox to 2.0.14 (TIKA-2834).

   * Add CSV detection and replace TXTParser with TextAndCSVParser;
     users can turn off CSV detection by excluding the TextAndCSVParser
     and adding back the TXTParser via tika-config (TIKA-2833).

   * Add a CSVParser.  CSV detection is currently based solely on filename
     and/or information conveyed via Metadata (TIKA-2826).

   * General upgrades: asm, bouncycastle, commons-codec, commons-lang3, cxf,
     guava, h2, httpcomponents, jackcess, junrar, Lucene, mime4j, opennlp, parso,
     sqlite-jdbc (provided), zstd-jni (provided) (TIKA-2824)

   * Bundle xerces2 with tika-parsers (TIKA-2802).

   * Upgrade jaxb to 2.3.2 (TIKA-2819).

   * Upgrade jackson to 2.9.8 (TIKA-2717).

   * Update tika-eval's common tokens lists (TIKA-2822).

   * Handle bad tags in tika-eval more robustly (TIKA-2810).

   * Add reports for tags in tika-eval (TIKA-2809).

   * Extract text from SDT element within textboxes in .docx files (TIKA-2807).

   * Try to handle truncated OOXML files more robustly (TIKA-2765).

Release 1.20 - 12/17/2018

   * Upgrade to POI 4.0.1 (TIKA-2751).

   * Integrate/parameterize new angles handling in
     PDFBox (TIKA-2779).

   * Upgrade to PDFBox 2.0.13 (TIKA-2788).

   * Prevent content within <style/> and <script/> elements
     to be written in the ToTextContentHandler (TIKA-2550).

   * Switch child to parent communication to a shared memory-mapped
     file in tika-server's -spawnChild mode.

   * Fix bug in tika-server when run in legacy mode (not -spawnChild)
     that caused it to return 503 on documents submitted after
     it hit an OutOfMemoryError (TIKA-2776).

   * Upgrade jaxb-runtime and javax.activation (TIKA-2778).

   * tika-app in batch mode now requires an interrupt or
     kill signal to the parent process to stop the parent
     and the child processes (TIKA-2780).

   * Bulk upgrade of dependencies (TIKA-2775).

   * Improve language id efficiency in tika-eval (TIKA-2777).

   * Upgrade sqlite "provided" dependency to 3.25.2 (TIKA-2773).

   * Remove duplication of notes in PPT slides (TIKA-2735)

   * Use -javaHome or $JAVA_HOME (if they exist) when
     spawning child in tika-server's -spawnChild mode.

   * Fixed closing of styles around Hyperlinks in Word Parser
     Contributed by Ronan O'Sullivan (TIKA-2599).

Release 1.19.1 - 10/4/2018

   * Update PDFBox to 2.0.12, jempbox to 1.8.16
     and jbig2 to 3.0.2 (TIKA-2745).

   * Remove dependency on slf4j-log4j12 by upgrading jmatio (TIKA-2742).

   * Replace com.sun.xml.bind:jaxb-impl and jaxb-core with
     org.glassfish.jaxb:jaxb-runtime and jaxb-core (TIKA-2743)

Release 1.19 - 9/14/2018

   * Require Java 8 (TIKA-2679).

   * Enable building with Java 11 (TIKA-2668)

   * Add an option to make tika-server robust against infinite loops,
     OOMs, and memory leaks (TIKA-2725).

   * Allow configuration of the Tesseract parser via the standard
     tika-config.xml options (TIKA-2705).

   * Improve handling of empty cells across table-based
     formats (TIKA-2479).

   * Add a Standards compliant HTML encoding detector
     via Gerard Bouchar (TIKA-2673).

   * Improved XML parsing -- limited default entity expansions to 20.
     To raise this limit, add -Djdk.xml.entityExpansionLimit=XXX to
     your commandline.

   * Mime magic improvements for Olympus RAW (TIKA-2658), interpreted
     server-side languages via HTTP (TIKA-2648), MHTML (TIKA-2723)

   * Add absolute timeout to ForkParser rather than testing
     for active (TIKA-2656).

   * Make the RecursiveParserWrapper work with the ForkParser (TIKA-2655).

   * Allow the ForkParser to specify a directory containing tika-app.jar
     for use by the ForkServer.  This allows users to keep most of the
     parser dependencies out of their code; and it allows for an easy
     addition of optional jars for Parser dependencies,
     such as the xerial sqlite jar (TIKA-2653).

   * Use a pool for SAXParsers and DOMBuilders rather than creating
     a new parser/builder for every parse.
     For better performance, set XMLReaderUtils.setPoolSize() to the
     number of threads you're using with Tika (TIKA-2645).

    Users who wish to parse only the container document should set
    an EmptyParser as the Parser.class in the ParseContext.

  * Change default behavior of Office Parsers to _not_ extract
    Macros.  User needs to setExtractMacros to "true" (TIKA-2302).

  * Added tika-eval module (TIKA-1332).

    languages and added a default implementation that call's Microsoft's
    translate service (TIKA-1319)

  * Added an Translator implementation that calls Lingo24's Premium
    Machine Translation API (TIKA-1381)

  * Made RTFParser's list handling slightly more robust against corrupt
    list metadata (TIKA-1305)

  * Fixed bug in CLI json output (TIKA-1291/TIKA-1310)

  * Added ability to turn off image extraction from PDFs (TIKA-1294).
    Users must now turn on this capability via the PDFParserConfig.

  * Upgrade to PDFBox 1.8.6 (TIKA-1290, TIKA-1231, TIKA-1233, TIKA-1352)

  * Zip Container Detection for DWFX and XPS formats, which are OPC
    based (TIKA-1204, TIKA-1221)

  * Added a user facing welcome page to the Tika Server, which
    says what it is, and a very brief summary of what is available. 
    (TIKA-1269)

  * Added Tika Server endpoints to list the available mime types,
    Parsers and Detectors, similar to the --list-<foo> methods on
    the Tika CLI App (TIKA-1270)

  * Improvements to NetCDF and HDF parsing to mimic the output of
    ncdump and extract text dimensions and spatial and variable
    information from scientific data files (TIKA-1265)

  * Extract attachments from RTF files (TIKA-1010)

  * Support Outlook Personal Folders File Format *.pst (TIKA-623)
  
  * Added mime entries for additional Ogg based formats (TIKA-1259)

  * Updated the Ogg Vorbis plugin to v0.4, which adds detection for a wider
    range of Ogg formats, and parsers for more Ogg Audio ones (TIKA-1113)

  * PDF: Images in PDF documents can now be extracted as embedded resources.
    (TIKA-1268)

  * Fixed RuntimeException thrown for certain Word Documents (TIKA-1251).

  * CLI: TikaCLI now has another option: --list-parser-details-apt, which outputs
    the list of supported parsers in APT format. This is used to generate the list
    on the formats page (TIKA-411).

Release 1.5 - 02/04/2014

    if the PDF itself was an attachment (TIKA-1124).

  * Text from paragraph-level structured document tags in DOCX files is now extracted (TIKA-1130).

  * RTF: Fixed ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when parsing list override (TIKA-1192).

  * CLI: TikaCLI now escapes invalid filename characters as hex
    characters (TIKA-1078).

Release 1.4 - 06/15/2013

  * Removed a test HTML file with a poorly chosen GPL text in it (TIKA-1129).

  * Improvements to tika-server to allow it to produce text/html and
    text/xml content (TIKA-1126, TIKA-1127).

  * Improvements were made to the Compressor Parser to handle g'zipped files
    that require the decompressConcatenated option set to true (TIKA-1096).

  * Addressed a typographic error that was preventing from detection of 
    awk files (TIKA-1081).

  * Added a new end-point to Tika's JAX-RS REST server that only detects
    the media-type based on a small portion of the document submitted
   (TIKA-1047).

  * RTF: Ordered and unordered lists are now extracted (TIKA-1062).

  * MP3: Audio duration is now extracted (TIKA-991)

  * Java .class files: upgraded from ASM 3.1 to ASM 4.1 for parsing
    the Java bytecodes (TIKA-1053).

  * Mime Types: Definitions extended to optionally include Link (URL) and
    UTI, along with details for several common formats (TIKA-1012 / TIKA-1083)

  * Exceptions when parsing OLE10 embedded documents, when parsing
    summary information from Office documents, and when saving
    embedded documennts in TikaCLI are now logged instead
    of aborting extraction (TIKA-1074)

  * MS Word: line tabular character is now replaced with newline
    (TIKA-1128)

  * XML: ElementMetadataHandlers can now optionally accept duplicate
    and empty values (TIKA-1133)

Release 1.3 - 01/19/2013

  * Mimetype definitions added for more common programming languages,
    including common extensions, but not magic patterns. (TIKA-1055)

  * MS Word: When a Word (.doc) document contains embedded files or
    links to external documents, Tika now places a <div
    class="embedded" id="_XXX"/> placeholder into the XHTML so you can
    see where in the main text the embedded document occurred
    (TIKA-956, TIKA-1019).  Embedded Wordpad/RTF documents are now
    recognized (TIKA-982).

  * PDF: Text from pop-up annotations is now extracted (TIKA-981).
    Text from bookmarks is now extracted (TIKA-1035).

  * PKCS7: Detached signatures no longer through NullPointerException
    (TIKA-986).

  * iWork: The chart name for charts embedded in numbers documents is
    now extracted (TIKA-918).

  * CLI: TikaCLI -m now handles multi-valued metadata keys correctly
    (previously it only printed the first value).  (TIKA-920)

  * MS Word (.docx): When a Word (.docx) document contains embedded
    files, Tika now places a <div class="embedded" id="XXX"/> into the
    XHTML so you can see where in the main text the embedded document
    occurred.  The id (rId) is included in the Metadata of each
    embedded document as the new Metadata.EMBEDDED_RELATIONSHIP_ID
    key, and TikaCLI prepends the rId (if present) onto the filename
    it extracts (TIKA-989).  Fixed NullPointerException when style is
    null (TIKA-1006).  Text inside text boxes is now extracted
    (TIKA-1005).

  * RTF: Page, word, character count and creation date metadata are
    now extracted for RTF documents (TIKA-999).

  * MS PowerPoint (.pptx): When a PowerPoint (.pptx) document contains
    embedded files, Tika now places a <div class="embedded" id="XXX"/> into the
    XHTML so you can see where in the main text the embedded document
    occurred.  The id (rId) is included in the Metadata of each
    embedded document as the new Metadata.EMBEDDED_RELATIONSHIP_ID
    key, and TikaCLI prepends the rId (if present) onto the filename
    it extracts (TIKA-997, TIKA-1032).

  * MS PowerPoint (.ppt): When a PowerPoint (.ppt) document contains
    embedded files, Tika now places a <div class="embedded" id="XXX"/> into the
    XHTML so you can see where in the main text the embedded document
    occurred (TIKA-1025).  Text from the master slide is now extracted
    (TIKA-712).

  * MHTML: fixed Null charset name exception when a mime part has an
    unrecognized charset (TIKA-1011).

  * MP3: if an ID3 tag was encoded in UTF-16 with only the BOM then on
    certain JVMs this would incorrectly extract the BOM as the tag's
    value (TIKA-1024).

  * ZIP: placeholders (<div class="embedded" id="<entry name>"/>) are
    now left in the XHTML so you can see where each archive member
    appears (TIKA-1036). TikaCLI would hit FileNotFoundException when
    extracting files that were under sub-directories from a ZIP
    archive, because it failed to create the parent directories first
    (TIKA-1031).

  * XML: a space character is now added before each element
    (TIKA-1048)

Release 1.2 - 07/10/2012
---------------------------------

  * Tika's JAX-RS based Network server now is based on Apache CXF,
    which is available in Maven Central and now allows the server
    module to be packaged and included in our release
    (TIKA-593, TIKA-901).

  * Tika: parseToString now lets you specify the max string length
    per-call, in addition to per-Tika-instance. (TIKA-870)

  * Tika now has the ability to detect FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) 
    files (TIKA-874).

  * Images: Fixed file handle leak in ImageParser. (TIKA-875)

  * iWork: Comments in Pages files are now extracted (TIKA-907).
    Headers, footers and footnotes in Pages files are now extracted
    (TIKA-906).  Don't throw NullPointerException on passsword
    protected iWork files, even though we can't parse their contents
    yet (TIKA-903).  Text extracted from Keynote text boxes and bullet
    points no longer runs together (TIKA-910). Also extract text for
    Pages documents created in layout mode (TIKA-904).  Table names
    are now extracted in Numbers documents (TIKA-924).  Content added
    to master slides is also extracted (TIKA-923).

  * Archive and compression formats: The Commons Compress dependency was
    upgraded from 1.3 to 1.4.1. With this change Tika can now parse also
    Unix dump archives and documents compressed using the XZ and Pack200
    compression formats. (TIKA-932)

  * KML: Tika now has basic support for Keyhole Markup Language documents
    (KML and KMZ) used by tools like Google Earth. See also
    http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/kml/. (TIKA-941)

  * CLI: You can now use the TIKA_PASSWORD environment variable or the
    --password=X command line option to specify the password that Tika CLI
    should use for opening encrypted documents (TIKA-943).

  * Character encodings: Tika's character encoding detection mechanism was
    improved by adding integration to the juniversalchardet library that
    implements Mozilla's universal charset detection algorithm. The slower
    ICU4J algorithms are still used as a fallback thanks to their wider
    coverage of custom character encodings. (TIKA-322, TIKA-471)

  * Charset parameter: Related to the character encoding improvements
    mentioned above, Tika now returns the detected character encoding as
    a "charset" parameter of the content type metadata field for text/plain
    and text/html documents. For example, instead of just "text/plain", the
    returned content type will be something like "text/plain; charset=UTF-8"
    for a UTF-8 encoded text document. Character encoding information is still
    present also in the content encoding metadata field for backwards
    compatibility, but that field should be considered deprecated. (TIKA-431)

  * Extraction of embedded resources from OLE2 Office Documents, where
    the resource isn't another office document, has been fixed (TIKA-948)

Release 1.1 - 3/7/2012
---------------------------------

 * Link Extraction: The rel attribute is now extracted from 
   links per the LinkConteHandler. (TIKA-824)

 * MP3: Fixed handling of UTF-16 (two byte) ID3v2 tags (previously
   the last character in a UTF-16 tag could be corrupted) (TIKA-793)

 * Performance: Loading of the default media type registry is now
   significantly faster. (TIKA-780)

 * PDF: Allow controlling whether overlapping duplicated text should
   be removed.  Disabling this (the default) can give big
   speedups to text extraction and may workaround cases where
   non-duplicated characters were incorrectly removed (TIKA-767).
   Allow controlling whether text tokens should be sorted by their x/y
   position before extracting text (TIKA-612); this is necessary for
   certain PDFs.  Fixed cases where too many </p> tags appear in the
   XHTML output, causing NPE when opening some PDFs with the GUI
   (TIKA-778).

 * RTF: Fixed case where a font change would result in processing
   bytes in the wrong font's charset, producing bogus text output
   (TIKA-777).  Don't output whitespace in ignored group states,
   avoiding excessive whitespace output (TIKA-781).  Binary embedded
   content (using \bin control word) is now skipped correctly;
   previously it could cause the parser to incorrectly extract binary
   content as text (TIKA-782).

 * CLI: New TikaCLI option "--list-detectors", which displays the
   mimetype detectors that are available, similar to the existing
   "--list-parsers" option for parsers. (TIKA-785).

 * Detectors: The order of detectors, as supplied via the service
   registry loader, is now controlled. User supplied detectors are
   prefered, then Tika detectors (such as the container aware ones),
   and finally the core Tika MimeTypes is used as a backup. This
   allows for specific, detailed detectors to take preference over
   the default mime magic + filename detector. (TIKA-786)

 * Microsoft Project (MPP): Filetype detection has been fixed,
   and basic metadata (but no text) is now extracted. (TIKA-789)

 * Outlook: fixed NullPointerException in TikaGUI when messages with
   embedded RTF or HTML content were filtered (TIKA-801).

 * Ogg Vorbis and FLAC: Parser added for Ogg Vorbis and FLAC audio
   files, which extract audio metadata and tags (TIKA-747)

 * MP4: Improved mime magic detection for MP4 based formats (including
   QuickTime, MP4 Video and Audio, and 3GPP) (TIKA-851)

 * MP4: Basic metadata extracting parser for MP4 files added, which includes
   limited audio and video metadata, along with the iTunes media metadata
   (such as Artist and Title) (TIKA-852)

 * Document Passwords: A new ParseContext object, PasswordProvider,
   has been added. This provides a way to supply the password for 
   a document during processing. Currently, only password protected
   PDFs and Microsoft OOXML Files are supported. (TIKA-850)

Release 1.0 - 11/4/2011
---------------------------------

The most notable changes in Tika 1.0 over previous releases are:

 * API: All methods, classes and interfaces that were marked as
   deprecated in Tika 0.10 have been removed to clean up the API
   (TIKA-703). You may need to adjust and recompile client code
   accordingly. The declared OSGi package versions are now 1.0, and
   will thus not resolve for client bundles that still refer to 0.x
   versions (TIKA-565).

 * Configuration: The context class loader of the current thread is
   no longer used as the default for loading configured parser and
   detector classes. You can still pass an explicit class loader
   to the configuration mechanism to get the previous behaviour.
   (TIKA-565)

 * OSGi: The tika-core bundle will now automatically pick up and use
   any available Parser and Detector services when deployed to an OSGi
   environment. The tika-parsers bundle provides such services based on
   for all the supported file formats for which the upstream parser library
   is available. If you don't want to track all the parser libraries as
   separate OSGi bundles, you can use the tika-bundle bundle that packages
   tika-parsers together with all its upstream dependencies. (TIKA-565)

 * RTF: Hyperlinks in RTF documents are now extracted as an <a
   href=...>...</a> element (TIKA-632). The RTF parser is also now
   more robust when encountering too many closing {'s vs. opening {'s
   (TIKA-733).

 * MS Word: From Word (.doc) documents we now extract optional hyphen
   as Unicode zero-width space (U+200B), and non-breaking hyphen as
   Unicode non-breaking hyphen (U+2011). (TIKA-711)

 * Outlook: Tika can now process also attachments in Outlook messages.
   (TIKA-396)

 * MS Office: Performance of extracting embedded office docs was improved.
   (TIKA-753)

 * PDF: The PDF parser now extracts paragraphs within each page 
   (TIKA-742) and  can now optionally extract text from PDF 
   annotations (TIKA-738). There's also an option to enable (the 
   default) or disable auto-space insertion (TIKA-724). 

 * Language detection: Tika can now detect Belarusian, Catalan,
   Esperanto, Galician, Lithuanian (TIKA-582), Romanian, Slovak,
   Slovenian, and Ukrainian (TIKA-681).

 * Java: Tika no longer ships retrotranslated Java 1.4 binaries along
   with the normal ones that work with Java 5 and higher. (TIKA-744)

 * OpenOffice documents: header/footer text is now extracted for text,
   presentation and spreadsheet documents (TIKA-736)

Release 0.10 - 09/25/2011
-------------------------

The most notable changes in Tika 0.10 over previous releases are:

 * A parser for CHM help files was added. (TIKA-245)

 * TIKA-698: Invalid characters are now replaced with the Unicode
   replacement character (U+FFFD), whereas before such characters were
   replaced with spaces, so you may need to change your processing of
   Tika's output to now handle U+FFFD.

 * The RTF parser was rewritten to perform its own direct shallow
   parse of the RTF content, instead of using RTFEditorKit from
   javax.swing.  This fixes several issues in the old parser,
   including doubling of Unicode characters in certain cases
   (TIKA-683), exceptions on mal-formed RTF docs (TIKA-666), and
   missing text from some elements (header/footer, hyperlinks,
   footnotes, text inside pictures).

 * Handling of temporary files within Tika was much improved
   (TIKA-701, TIKA-654, TIKA-645, TIKA-153)

 * The Tika GUI got a facelift and some extra features (TIKA-635)

 * The apache-mime4j dependency of the email message parser was upgraded
   from version 0.6 to 0.7 (TIKA-716). The parser also now accepts a
   MimeConfig object in the ParseContext as configuration (TIKA-640).

Tika 0.10 relies on the following set of major dependencies (generated using
mvn dependency:tree from tika-parsers):

Release 0.9 - 02/13/2011
------------------------

The most notable changes in Tika 0.9 over previous releases are:

 * A critical bugfix preventing metadata from printing to the 
   command line when the underlying Parser didn't generate 
   XHTML output was fixed. (TIKA-596)
   
 * The 0.8 version of Tika included a NetCDF jar file that pulled 
   in tremendous amounts of redundant dependencies. This has 
   been addressed in Tika 0.9 by republishing a minimal NetCDF 
   jar and changing Tika to depend on that. (TIKA-556)
   
 * MIME detection for iWork, and OpenXML documents has been 
   improved. (TIKA-533, TIKA-562, TIKA-588)
   
 * A critical backwards incompatible bug in PDF parsing that 
   was introduced in Tika 0.8 has been fixed. (TIKA-548)
   
 * Support for forked parsing in separate processes was added. 
   (TIKA-416)
 
 * Tika's language identifier now supports the Lithuanian 
   language. (TIKA-582)

Tika 0.9 relies on the following set of major dependencies (generated using
mvn dependency:tree from tika-parsers):

   org.apache.tika:tika-parsers:bundle:0.9
   +- org.apache.tika:tika-core:jar:0.9:compile
   +- edu.ucar:netcdf:jar:4.2-min:compile
   |  \- org.slf4j:slf4j-api:jar:1.5.6:compile

Release 0.8 - 11/07/2010
------------------------

The most notable changes in Tika 0.8 over previous releases are:

 * Language identification is now dynamically configurable, 
   managed via a config file loaded from the classpath. (TIKA-490)

 * Tika now supports parsing Feeds by wrapping the underlying
   Rome library. (TIKA-466)

 * A quick-start guide for Tika parsing was contributed. (TIKA-464)

 * An approach for plumbing through XHTML attributes was added. (TIKA-379)

 * Media type hierarchy information is now taken into account when
   selecting the best parser for a given input document. (TIKA-298)

 * Support for parsing common scientific data formats including netCDF
   and HDF4/5 was added (TIKA-400 and TIKA-399).

 * Unit tests for Windows have been fixed, allowing TestParsers
   to complete. (TIKA-398)

Release 0.7 - 3/31/2010
-----------------------

The most notable changes in Tika 0.7 over previous releases are:

 * MP3 file parsing was improved, including Channel and SampleRate 
   extraction and ID3v2 support (TIKA-368, TIKA-372). Further, audio
   parsing mime detection was also improved for the MIDI format. (TIKA-199)

 * Tika no longer relies on X11 for its RTF parsing functionality. (TIKA-386)

 * A Thread-safe bug in the AutoDetectParser was discovered and 
   addressed. (TIKA-374)

 * Upgrade to PDFBox 1.0.0. The new PDFBox version improves PDF parsing
   performance and fixes a number of text extraction issues. (TIKA-380)

Release 0.6 - 01/20/2010
------------------------

The most notable changes in Tika 0.6 over the previous release are:

 * Mime-type detection for HTML (and all types) has been improved, allowing malformed
   HTML files and those HTML files that require a bit more observed content
   before the type is properly detected, are now correctly identified by 
   the AutoDetectParser. (TIKA-327, TIKA-357, TIKA-366, TIKA-367)

 * Tika now has an additional OSGi bundle packaging that includes all the
   required parser libraries. This bundle package makes it easy to use all
   Tika features in an OSGi environment. (TIKA-340, TIKA-342)

 * The Apache POI dependency used for parsing Microsoft Office file formats
   has been upgraded to version 3.6. The most visible improvement in this
   version is the notably reduced ooxml jar file size. The tika-app jar size
   is now down to 15MB from the 25MB in Tika 0.5. (TIKA-353)

 * Handling of character encoding information in input metadata and HTML
   <meta> tags has been improved. When no applicable encoding information is
   available, the encoding is detected by looking at the input data.
   (TIKA-332, TIKA-334, TIKA-335, TIKA-341) 

 * Some document types like Excel spreadsheets contain content like
   numbers or formulas whose exact text format depends on the current locale.
   So far Tika has used the platform default locale in such cases, but
   clients can now explicitly specify the locale by passing a Locale instance
   in the parse context. (TIKA-125)

 * The default text output encoding of the tika-app jar is now UTF-8
   when running on Mac OS X. This is because the default encoding used
   by Java is not compatible with the console application in Mac OS X.
   On all other platforms the text output from tika-app still uses
   the platform default encoding. (TIKA-324)

 * A flash video (video/x-flv) parser has been added. (TIKA-328)
 
 * The handling of Number and Date cell formatting within the Microsoft Excel
   documents has been added. This include currencies, percentages and
   scientific formats. (TIKA-103)

Release 0.5 - 11/14/2009
------------------------

The most notable changes in Tika 0.5 over the previous release are:

 * Improved RDF/OWL mime detection using both MIME magic as well as
   pattern matching (TIKA-309)

 * An org.apache.tika.Tika facade class has been added to simplify common
   text extraction and type detection use cases. (TIKA-269)

 * A new parse context argument was added to the Parser.parse() method.
   This context map can be used to pass things like a delegate parser or
   other settings to the parsing process. The previous parse() method
   signature has been deprecated and will be removed in Tika 1.0. (TIKA-275)

 * A simple ngram-based language detection mechanism has been added along
   with predefined language profiles for 18 languages. (TIKA-209)

 * The media type registry in Tika was synchronized with the MIME type
   configuration in the Apache HTTP Server. Tika now knows about 1274
   different media types and can detect 672 of those using 927 file
   extension and 280 magic byte patterns. (TIKA-285)

 * Tika now uses the Apache PDFBox version 0.8.0-incubating for parsing PDF
   documents. This version is notably better than the 0.7.3 release used
   earlier. (TIKA-158)

Release 0.4 - 07/14/2009
------------------------

The most notable changes in Tika 0.4 over the previous release are:

  * Tika has been split to three different components for increased
    modularity. The tika-core component contains the key interfaces and
    core functionality of Tika, tika-parsers contains all the adapters
    to external parser libraries, and tika-app bundles everything together
    in a single executable jar file. (TIKA-219)

  * All the three Tika components are packaged as OSGi bundles. (TIKA-228)

  * Tika now uses the new Commons Compress library for improved support
    of compression and packaging formats like gzip, bzip2, tar, cpio,
    ar, zip and jar. (TIKA-204)

  * The memory use of parsing Excel sheets with lots of numbers
    has been considerably reduced. (TIKA-211)

  * The AutoDetectParser now has basic protection against "zip bomb"
    attacks, where a specially crafted input document can expand to
    practically infinite amount of output text. (TIKA-216)

  * The ParsingReader class can now use a thread pool or a more complex
    execution model (java.util.concurrent.Executor) for the background
    parsing task. (TIKA-215)

  * Automatic type detection of text- and XML-based documents has been
    improved. (TIKA-225)

  * Charset detection functionality from the ICU4J library was inlined
    in Tika to avoid the dependency to the large ICU4J jar. (TIKA-229)

  * Composite parsers like the AutoDetectParser now make sure that any
    RuntimeExceptions, IOExceptions or SAXExceptions unrelated to the given
    document stream or content handler are converted to TikaExceptions
    before being passed to the client. (TIKA-198, TIKA-237)

Release 0.3 - 03/09/2009
------------------------

The most notable changes in Tika 0.3 over the previous release are:

 * Tika now supports mime type glob patterns specified using
   standard JDK 1.4 (and beyond) syntax via the isregex attribute
   on the glob tag. See:

     http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html

   for more information. (TIKA-194)

 * Tika now supports the Office Open XML format used by
   Microsoft Office 2007. (TIKA-152)

 * All the metadata keys for Microsoft Office document properties are now
   included as constants in the MSOffice interface. Clients should use
   these constants instead of the raw string values to refer to specific
   metadata items. (TIKA-186)

 * Automatic detection of document types in Tika has been improved.
   For example Tika can now detect plain text just by looking at the first
   few bytes of the document. (TIKA-154)

 * Tika now disables the loading of all external entities in XML files
   that it parses as input documents. This improves security and avoids
   problems with potentially broken references. (TIKA-185)

 * Tika now replaces all invalid XML characters in the extracted text
   content with spaces. This prevents problems when output from Tika
   is processed with XML tools. (TIKA-180)

 * The Tika CLI now correctly flushes its buffers when invoked with the
   --text argument. This prevents the end of the text output from being
   lost. (TIKA-179)

 * Embedded text in MIDI files is now extracted. For example many karaoke
   files contain song lyrics embedded as MIDI text.

 * The text content of Microsoft Outlook message files no longer appears as
   multiple copies in the extracted text. (TIKA-197)

 * The ParsingReader class now makes most document metadata available
   already before any of the extracted text is consumed. This makes it
   easier for example to construct Lucene Document instances that contain
   both extracted text and metadata. (TIKA-203)
