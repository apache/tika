    UTI, along with details for several common formats (TIKA-1012 / TIKA-1083)

  * Exceptions when parsing OLE10 embedded documents, when parsing
    summary information from Office documents, and when saving
    embedded documennts in TikaCLI are now logged instead
    of aborting extraction (TIKA-1074)

  * MS Word: line tabular character is now replaced with newline
    (TIKA-1128)

  * XML: ElementMetadataHandlers can now optionally accept duplicate
    and empty values (TIKA-1133)

Release 1.3 - 01/19/2013

  * Mimetype definitions added for more common programming languages,
    including common extensions, but not magic patterns. (TIKA-1055)

  * MS Word: When a Word (.doc) document contains embedded files or
    links to external documents, Tika now places a <div
    class="embedded" id="_XXX"/> placeholder into the XHTML so you can
    see where in the main text the embedded document occurred
    (TIKA-956, TIKA-1019).  Embedded Wordpad/RTF documents are now
    recognized (TIKA-982).

  * PDF: Text from pop-up annotations is now extracted (TIKA-981).
    Text from bookmarks is now extracted (TIKA-1035).

  * PKCS7: Detached signatures no longer through NullPointerException
    (TIKA-986).

  * iWork: The chart name for charts embedded in numbers documents is
    now extracted (TIKA-918).

  * CLI: TikaCLI -m now handles multi-valued metadata keys correctly
    (previously it only printed the first value).  (TIKA-920)

  * MS Word (.docx): When a Word (.docx) document contains embedded
    files, Tika now places a <div class="embedded" id="XXX"/> into the
    XHTML so you can see where in the main text the embedded document
    occurred.  The id (rId) is included in the Metadata of each
    embedded document as the new Metadata.EMBEDDED_RELATIONSHIP_ID
    key, and TikaCLI prepends the rId (if present) onto the filename
    it extracts (TIKA-989).  Fixed NullPointerException when style is
    null (TIKA-1006).  Text inside text boxes is now extracted
    (TIKA-1005).

  * RTF: Page, word, character count and creation date metadata are
    now extracted for RTF documents (TIKA-999).

  * MS PowerPoint (.pptx): When a PowerPoint (.pptx) document contains
    embedded files, Tika now places a <div class="embedded" id="XXX"/> into the
    XHTML so you can see where in the main text the embedded document
    occurred.  The id (rId) is included in the Metadata of each
    embedded document as the new Metadata.EMBEDDED_RELATIONSHIP_ID
    key, and TikaCLI prepends the rId (if present) onto the filename
    it extracts (TIKA-997, TIKA-1032).

  * MS PowerPoint (.ppt): When a PowerPoint (.ppt) document contains
    embedded files, Tika now places a <div class="embedded" id="XXX"/> into the
    XHTML so you can see where in the main text the embedded document
    occurred (TIKA-1025).  Text from the master slide is now extracted
    (TIKA-712).

  * MHTML: fixed Null charset name exception when a mime part has an
    unrecognized charset (TIKA-1011).

  * MP3: if an ID3 tag was encoded in UTF-16 with only the BOM then on
    certain JVMs this would incorrectly extract the BOM as the tag's
    value (TIKA-1024).

  * ZIP: placeholders (<div class="embedded" id="<entry name>"/>) are
    now left in the XHTML so you can see where each archive member
    appears (TIKA-1036). TikaCLI would hit FileNotFoundException when
    extracting files that were under sub-directories from a ZIP
    archive, because it failed to create the parent directories first
    (TIKA-1031).

  * XML: a space character is now added before each element
    (TIKA-1048)

Release 1.2 - 07/10/2012
---------------------------------

  * Tika's JAX-RS based Network server now is based on Apache CXF,
    which is available in Maven Central and now allows the server
    module to be packaged and included in our release
    (TIKA-593, TIKA-901).

  * Tika: parseToString now lets you specify the max string length
    per-call, in addition to per-Tika-instance. (TIKA-870)

  * Tika now has the ability to detect FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) 
    files (TIKA-874).

  * Images: Fixed file handle leak in ImageParser. (TIKA-875)

  * iWork: Comments in Pages files are now extracted (TIKA-907).
    Headers, footers and footnotes in Pages files are now extracted
    (TIKA-906).  Don't throw NullPointerException on passsword
    protected iWork files, even though we can't parse their contents
    yet (TIKA-903).  Text extracted from Keynote text boxes and bullet
    points no longer runs together (TIKA-910). Also extract text for
    Pages documents created in layout mode (TIKA-904).  Table names
    are now extracted in Numbers documents (TIKA-924).  Content added
    to master slides is also extracted (TIKA-923).

  * Archive and compression formats: The Commons Compress dependency was
    upgraded from 1.3 to 1.4.1. With this change Tika can now parse also
    Unix dump archives and documents compressed using the XZ and Pack200
    compression formats. (TIKA-932)

  * KML: Tika now has basic support for Keyhole Markup Language documents
    (KML and KMZ) used by tools like Google Earth. See also
    http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/kml/. (TIKA-941)

  * CLI: You can now use the TIKA_PASSWORD environment variable or the
    --password=X command line option to specify the password that Tika CLI
    should use for opening encrypted documents (TIKA-943).

  * Character encodings: Tika's character encoding detection mechanism was
    improved by adding integration to the juniversalchardet library that
    implements Mozilla's universal charset detection algorithm. The slower
    ICU4J algorithms are still used as a fallback thanks to their wider
    coverage of custom character encodings. (TIKA-322, TIKA-471)

  * Charset parameter: Related to the character encoding improvements
    mentioned above, Tika now returns the detected character encoding as
    a "charset" parameter of the content type metadata field for text/plain
    and text/html documents. For example, instead of just "text/plain", the
    returned content type will be something like "text/plain; charset=UTF-8"
    for a UTF-8 encoded text document. Character encoding information is still
    present also in the content encoding metadata field for backwards
    compatibility, but that field should be considered deprecated. (TIKA-431)

  * Extraction of embedded resources from OLE2 Office Documents, where
    the resource isn't another office document, has been fixed (TIKA-948)

Release 1.1 - 3/7/2012
---------------------------------

 * Link Extraction: The rel attribute is now extracted from 
   links per the LinkConteHandler. (TIKA-824)

 * MP3: Fixed handling of UTF-16 (two byte) ID3v2 tags (previously
   the last character in a UTF-16 tag could be corrupted) (TIKA-793)

 * Performance: Loading of the default media type registry is now
   significantly faster. (TIKA-780)

 * PDF: Allow controlling whether overlapping duplicated text should
   be removed.  Disabling this (the default) can give big
   speedups to text extraction and may workaround cases where
   non-duplicated characters were incorrectly removed (TIKA-767).
   Allow controlling whether text tokens should be sorted by their x/y
   position before extracting text (TIKA-612); this is necessary for
   certain PDFs.  Fixed cases where too many </p> tags appear in the
   XHTML output, causing NPE when opening some PDFs with the GUI
   (TIKA-778).

 * RTF: Fixed case where a font change would result in processing
   bytes in the wrong font's charset, producing bogus text output
   (TIKA-777).  Don't output whitespace in ignored group states,
   avoiding excessive whitespace output (TIKA-781).  Binary embedded
   content (using \bin control word) is now skipped correctly;
   previously it could cause the parser to incorrectly extract binary
   content as text (TIKA-782).

 * CLI: New TikaCLI option "--list-detectors", which displays the
   mimetype detectors that are available, similar to the existing
   "--list-parsers" option for parsers. (TIKA-785).

 * Detectors: The order of detectors, as supplied via the service
   registry loader, is now controlled. User supplied detectors are
   prefered, then Tika detectors (such as the container aware ones),
   and finally the core Tika MimeTypes is used as a backup. This
   allows for specific, detailed detectors to take preference over
   the default mime magic + filename detector. (TIKA-786)

 * Microsoft Project (MPP): Filetype detection has been fixed,
   and basic metadata (but no text) is now extracted. (TIKA-789)

 * Outlook: fixed NullPointerException in TikaGUI when messages with
   embedded RTF or HTML content were filtered (TIKA-801).

 * Ogg Vorbis and FLAC: Parser added for Ogg Vorbis and FLAC audio
   files, which extract audio metadata and tags (TIKA-747)

 * MP4: Improved mime magic detection for MP4 based formats (including
   QuickTime, MP4 Video and Audio, and 3GPP) (TIKA-851)

 * MP4: Basic metadata extracting parser for MP4 files added, which includes
   limited audio and video metadata, along with the iTunes media metadata
   (such as Artist and Title) (TIKA-852)

 * Document Passwords: A new ParseContext object, PasswordProvider,
   has been added. This provides a way to supply the password for 
   a document during processing. Currently, only password protected
   PDFs and Microsoft OOXML Files are supported. (TIKA-850)

Release 1.0 - 11/4/2011
---------------------------------

The most notable changes in Tika 1.0 over previous releases are:

 * API: All methods, classes and interfaces that were marked as
   deprecated in Tika 0.10 have been removed to clean up the API
   (TIKA-703). You may need to adjust and recompile client code
   accordingly. The declared OSGi package versions are now 1.0, and
   will thus not resolve for client bundles that still refer to 0.x
   versions (TIKA-565).

 * Configuration: The context class loader of the current thread is
   no longer used as the default for loading configured parser and
   detector classes. You can still pass an explicit class loader
   to the configuration mechanism to get the previous behaviour.
   (TIKA-565)

 * OSGi: The tika-core bundle will now automatically pick up and use
   any available Parser and Detector services when deployed to an OSGi
   environment. The tika-parsers bundle provides such services based on
   for all the supported file formats for which the upstream parser library
   is available. If you don't want to track all the parser libraries as
   separate OSGi bundles, you can use the tika-bundle bundle that packages
   tika-parsers together with all its upstream dependencies. (TIKA-565)

 * RTF: Hyperlinks in RTF documents are now extracted as an <a
   href=...>...</a> element (TIKA-632). The RTF parser is also now
   more robust when encountering too many closing {'s vs. opening {'s
   (TIKA-733).

 * MS Word: From Word (.doc) documents we now extract optional hyphen
   as Unicode zero-width space (U+200B), and non-breaking hyphen as
   Unicode non-breaking hyphen (U+2011). (TIKA-711)

 * Outlook: Tika can now process also attachments in Outlook messages.
   (TIKA-396)

 * MS Office: Performance of extracting embedded office docs was improved.
   (TIKA-753)

 * PDF: The PDF parser now extracts paragraphs within each page 
   (TIKA-742) and  can now optionally extract text from PDF 
   annotations (TIKA-738). There's also an option to enable (the 
   default) or disable auto-space insertion (TIKA-724). 

 * Language detection: Tika can now detect Belarusian, Catalan,
   Esperanto, Galician, Lithuanian (TIKA-582), Romanian, Slovak,
   Slovenian, and Ukrainian (TIKA-681).

 * Java: Tika no longer ships retrotranslated Java 1.4 binaries along
   with the normal ones that work with Java 5 and higher. (TIKA-744)

 * OpenOffice documents: header/footer text is now extracted for text,
   presentation and spreadsheet documents (TIKA-736)

Release 0.10 - 09/25/2011
-------------------------

The most notable changes in Tika 0.10 over previous releases are:

 * A parser for CHM help files was added. (TIKA-245)

 * TIKA-698: Invalid characters are now replaced with the Unicode
   replacement character (U+FFFD), whereas before such characters were
   replaced with spaces, so you may need to change your processing of
   Tika's output to now handle U+FFFD.

 * The RTF parser was rewritten to perform its own direct shallow
   parse of the RTF content, instead of using RTFEditorKit from
   javax.swing.  This fixes several issues in the old parser,
   including doubling of Unicode characters in certain cases
   (TIKA-683), exceptions on mal-formed RTF docs (TIKA-666), and
   missing text from some elements (header/footer, hyperlinks,
   footnotes, text inside pictures).

 * Handling of temporary files within Tika was much improved
   (TIKA-701, TIKA-654, TIKA-645, TIKA-153)

 * The Tika GUI got a facelift and some extra features (TIKA-635)

 * The apache-mime4j dependency of the email message parser was upgraded
   from version 0.6 to 0.7 (TIKA-716). The parser also now accepts a
   MimeConfig object in the ParseContext as configuration (TIKA-640).

Release 0.9 - 02/13/2011
------------------------

The most notable changes in Tika 0.9 over previous releases are:

 * A critical bugfix preventing metadata from printing to the 
   command line when the underlying Parser didn't generate 
   XHTML output was fixed. (TIKA-596)
   
 * The 0.8 version of Tika included a NetCDF jar file that pulled 
   in tremendous amounts of redundant dependencies. This has 
   been addressed in Tika 0.9 by republishing a minimal NetCDF 
   jar and changing Tika to depend on that. (TIKA-556)
   
 * MIME detection for iWork, and OpenXML documents has been 
   improved. (TIKA-533, TIKA-562, TIKA-588)
   
 * A critical backwards incompatible bug in PDF parsing that 
   was introduced in Tika 0.8 has been fixed. (TIKA-548)
   
 * Support for forked parsing in separate processes was added. 
   (TIKA-416)
 
 * Tika's language identifier now supports the Lithuanian 
   language. (TIKA-582)

Tika 0.9 relies on the following set of major dependencies (generated using
mvn dependency:tree from tika-parsers):

   org.apache.tika:tika-parsers:bundle:0.9

Release 0.8 - 11/07/2010
------------------------

The most notable changes in Tika 0.8 over previous releases are:

 * Language identification is now dynamically configurable, 
   managed via a config file loaded from the classpath. (TIKA-490)

 * Tika now supports parsing Feeds by wrapping the underlying
   Rome library. (TIKA-466)

 * A quick-start guide for Tika parsing was contributed. (TIKA-464)

 * An approach for plumbing through XHTML attributes was added. (TIKA-379)

 * Media type hierarchy information is now taken into account when
   selecting the best parser for a given input document. (TIKA-298)

 * Support for parsing common scientific data formats including netCDF
   and HDF4/5 was added (TIKA-400 and TIKA-399).

 * Unit tests for Windows have been fixed, allowing TestParsers
   to complete. (TIKA-398)

Tika 0.8 relies on the following set of major dependencies (generated using

Release 0.7 - 3/31/2010
-----------------------

The most notable changes in Tika 0.7 over previous releases are:

 * MP3 file parsing was improved, including Channel and SampleRate 
   extraction and ID3v2 support (TIKA-368, TIKA-372). Further, audio
   parsing mime detection was also improved for the MIDI format. (TIKA-199)

 * Tika no longer relies on X11 for its RTF parsing functionality. (TIKA-386)

 * A Thread-safe bug in the AutoDetectParser was discovered and 
   addressed. (TIKA-374)

 * Upgrade to PDFBox 1.0.0. The new PDFBox version improves PDF parsing
   performance and fixes a number of text extraction issues. (TIKA-380)

Release 0.6 - 01/20/2010
------------------------

The most notable changes in Tika 0.6 over the previous release are:

 * Mime-type detection for HTML (and all types) has been improved, allowing malformed
   HTML files and those HTML files that require a bit more observed content
   before the type is properly detected, are now correctly identified by 
   the AutoDetectParser. (TIKA-327, TIKA-357, TIKA-366, TIKA-367)

 * Tika now has an additional OSGi bundle packaging that includes all the
   required parser libraries. This bundle package makes it easy to use all
   Tika features in an OSGi environment. (TIKA-340, TIKA-342)

 * The Apache POI dependency used for parsing Microsoft Office file formats
   has been upgraded to version 3.6. The most visible improvement in this
   version is the notably reduced ooxml jar file size. The tika-app jar size
   is now down to 15MB from the 25MB in Tika 0.5. (TIKA-353)

 * Handling of character encoding information in input metadata and HTML
   <meta> tags has been improved. When no applicable encoding information is
   available, the encoding is detected by looking at the input data.
   (TIKA-332, TIKA-334, TIKA-335, TIKA-341) 

 * Some document types like Excel spreadsheets contain content like
   numbers or formulas whose exact text format depends on the current locale.
   So far Tika has used the platform default locale in such cases, but
   clients can now explicitly specify the locale by passing a Locale instance
   in the parse context. (TIKA-125)

 * The default text output encoding of the tika-app jar is now UTF-8
   when running on Mac OS X. This is because the default encoding used
   by Java is not compatible with the console application in Mac OS X.
   On all other platforms the text output from tika-app still uses
   the platform default encoding. (TIKA-324)

 * A flash video (video/x-flv) parser has been added. (TIKA-328)
 
 * The handling of Number and Date cell formatting within the Microsoft Excel
   documents has been added. This include currencies, percentages and
   scientific formats. (TIKA-103)

Release 0.5 - 11/14/2009
------------------------

The most notable changes in Tika 0.5 over the previous release are:

 * Improved RDF/OWL mime detection using both MIME magic as well as
   pattern matching (TIKA-309)

 * An org.apache.tika.Tika facade class has been added to simplify common
   text extraction and type detection use cases. (TIKA-269)

 * A new parse context argument was added to the Parser.parse() method.
   This context map can be used to pass things like a delegate parser or
   other settings to the parsing process. The previous parse() method
   signature has been deprecated and will be removed in Tika 1.0. (TIKA-275)

 * A simple ngram-based language detection mechanism has been added along
   with predefined language profiles for 18 languages. (TIKA-209)

 * The media type registry in Tika was synchronized with the MIME type
   configuration in the Apache HTTP Server. Tika now knows about 1274
   different media types and can detect 672 of those using 927 file
   extension and 280 magic byte patterns. (TIKA-285)

 * Tika now uses the Apache PDFBox version 0.8.0-incubating for parsing PDF
   documents. This version is notably better than the 0.7.3 release used
   earlier. (TIKA-158)

Release 0.4 - 07/14/2009
------------------------

The most notable changes in Tika 0.4 over the previous release are:

  * Tika has been split to three different components for increased
    modularity. The tika-core component contains the key interfaces and
    core functionality of Tika, tika-parsers contains all the adapters
    to external parser libraries, and tika-app bundles everything together
    in a single executable jar file. (TIKA-219)

  * All the three Tika components are packaged as OSGi bundles. (TIKA-228)

  * Tika now uses the new Commons Compress library for improved support
    of compression and packaging formats like gzip, bzip2, tar, cpio,
    ar, zip and jar. (TIKA-204)

  * The memory use of parsing Excel sheets with lots of numbers
    has been considerably reduced. (TIKA-211)

  * The AutoDetectParser now has basic protection against "zip bomb"
    attacks, where a specially crafted input document can expand to
    practically infinite amount of output text. (TIKA-216)

  * The ParsingReader class can now use a thread pool or a more complex
    execution model (java.util.concurrent.Executor) for the background
    parsing task. (TIKA-215)

  * Automatic type detection of text- and XML-based documents has been
    improved. (TIKA-225)

  * Charset detection functionality from the ICU4J library was inlined
    in Tika to avoid the dependency to the large ICU4J jar. (TIKA-229)

  * Composite parsers like the AutoDetectParser now make sure that any
    RuntimeExceptions, IOExceptions or SAXExceptions unrelated to the given
    document stream or content handler are converted to TikaExceptions
    before being passed to the client. (TIKA-198, TIKA-237)

Release 0.3 - 03/09/2009
------------------------

The most notable changes in Tika 0.3 over the previous release are:

 * Tika now supports mime type glob patterns specified using
   standard JDK 1.4 (and beyond) syntax via the isregex attribute
   on the glob tag. See:

     http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html

   for more information. (TIKA-194)

 * Tika now supports the Office Open XML format used by
   Microsoft Office 2007. (TIKA-152)

 * All the metadata keys for Microsoft Office document properties are now
   included as constants in the MSOffice interface. Clients should use
   these constants instead of the raw string values to refer to specific
   metadata items. (TIKA-186)

 * Automatic detection of document types in Tika has been improved.
   For example Tika can now detect plain text just by looking at the first
   few bytes of the document. (TIKA-154)

 * Tika now disables the loading of all external entities in XML files
   that it parses as input documents. This improves security and avoids
   problems with potentially broken references. (TIKA-185)

 * Tika now replaces all invalid XML characters in the extracted text
   content with spaces. This prevents problems when output from Tika
   is processed with XML tools. (TIKA-180)

 * The Tika CLI now correctly flushes its buffers when invoked with the
   --text argument. This prevents the end of the text output from being
   lost. (TIKA-179)

 * Embedded text in MIDI files is now extracted. For example many karaoke
   files contain song lyrics embedded as MIDI text.

 * The text content of Microsoft Outlook message files no longer appears as
   multiple copies in the extracted text. (TIKA-197)

 * The ParsingReader class now makes most document metadata available
   already before any of the extracted text is consumed. This makes it
   easier for example to construct Lucene Document instances that contain
   both extracted text and metadata. (TIKA-203)
