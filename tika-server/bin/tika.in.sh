# Settings here will override settings in existing env vars or in bin/tika.  The default shipped state
# of this file is completely commented.

# By default the script will use JAVA_HOME to determine which java
# to use, but you can set a specific path for Tika to use without
# affecting other Java applications on your server/workstation.
#TIKA_JAVA_HOME=""

# This controls the number of seconds that the Tika script will wait for
# Tika to start.  If the start fails, the script will
# give up waiting and display the last few lines of the logfile.
#TIKA_STOP_WAIT="180"

# Enable verbose GC logging...
#  * If this is unset, various default options will be selected depending on which JVM version is in use
#  * For Java 8: if this is set, additional params will be added to specify the log file & rotation
#  * For Java 9 or higher: each included opt param that starts with '-Xlog:gc', but does not include an
#    output specifier, will have a 'file' output specifier (as well as formatting & rollover options)
#    appended, using the effective value of the TIKA_LOGS_DIR.
#
#GC_LOG_OPTS='-Xlog:gc*'  # (Java 9+)
#GC_LOG_OPTS="-verbose:gc -XX:+PrintHeapAtGC -XX:+PrintGCDetails \
#  -XX:+PrintGCDateStamps -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps -XX:+PrintTenuringDistribution -XX:+PrintGCApplicationStoppedTime"

# These GC settings have shown to work well for a number of common Solr workloads.  Good for Tika?

# Anything you add to the TIKA_OPTS variable will be included in the java
# start command line as-is, in ADDITION to other options. If you specify the
# -a option on start script, those options will be appended as well. Examples:
#TIKA_OPTS="$TIKA_OPTS -Dlog4j.configuration=file:log4j_server.xml"

# Location where the bin/tika script will save PID files for running instances
# If not set, the script will create PID files in /var/tika
#TIKA_PID_DIR=

# Tika provides a default Log4J configuration properties file in tika-server.jar
# however, you may want to customize the log settings and file appender location
# so you can point the script to use a different log4j.properties file
#LOG4J_PROPS=/var/tika/log4j.properties

# Location where Tika should write logs to.
#TIKA_LOGS_DIR=/var/tika/logs

# Sets the port Tika binds to, default is 9998
#TIKA_PORT=9998

# Tika Server has a number of options to make it more robust to OOMs, Infinite
# Loops, and Memory Leaks via the -spawnChild parameter. Learn more at
