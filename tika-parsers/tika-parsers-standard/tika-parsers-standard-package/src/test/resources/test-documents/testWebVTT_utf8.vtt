00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.010
Well, the feedback indicates

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.880
that many new hires aren't sure

3
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.560
where to find information related

4
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.390
to HR, benefits and other onboarding processes

5
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.050
or who to ask.

6
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.850
Also, they're not always sure where they belong

7
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.740
in the structure of the company.

8
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.470
Because the company is growing and changing,

9
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.890
even tenured employees are getting confused

10
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.663
about who does what and who reports to whom.
