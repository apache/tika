crossed!)</pre>


<!-- Date: Mon Jul 7 00:18:40.661 2003 -->
Problems with H- ion source.  Needs to be fixed before the 
shot.  MCR says that the experts are on their way.  More beam 
studies to follow.  Shot won't be before ~ 4 am, but may be 
as late as noon (current guess).

Big Brother:  b0dau30 has a TROUBLE indicator in the disk catagory.  Here are the details:<br><br>

Some other partitions have close to 90% usage, but they are labeled "backup", so I don't think it's an issue.

MCR guarantees at least half an hour of quiet time, so doing 
the short version of calibrations (i.e. no laser and no Si).

Done with easy calibrations.  MCR has problems with humid air in 
the annex, and say we'll have at least an hour (or two) of 
extra quiet time.

Beam status from MCR: linac is still off + problems with keeping 
the antiproton stack (they are trying to lower the unstacking 
rate).  Bottom line: quiet time for the next couple of hours. 
 
<p> 
our plan: continue with the calibrations.  We took a silicon 
calibration run before realizing that the Si has to be biased 
for a while. (We're still learning.)  So we'll take cosmics 
for ~ 2 hr with the silicon on, and then take the silicon 
calibration.

The Si D-mode calibration just performed was done shortly after the Si HV was turned on.  The purpose of this run is to keep the Si operating for a while as per the Si calib. instructions.  MCR estimate of quiet time should be enough for cosmics run + 2 more Si calib's.

Done with another pass on Si calibrations.  (This time let's hope 
they are good.)

Put everything to standby, called MCR, and they've just loaded

There is a hope for a shot in about an hour from now.

Touched base with MCR: the coalescing is very bad, and they 
have an expert looking into it.  (For the past hour they have 
been injecting 2-4 bunches of protons and looking into the 
orbits.)  If they are happy with the coalescing this time, 
we may get a shot in half an hour.  But they said "do not 
hold your breath"...

<font color=red>Shift Summary: </font>Contrary to the evening shift (and the owl in previous nights), we have  
had suprisingly little trouble: no silicon PS troubles, only a few DONE 
timeouts... 
 
<p> 
Started with a stack of 190 and likely shot setup.  Linac was down for 
a while.  Tevatron had lots of small problems, and now they don't like 
the coalescing.  The shot in the near future is still likely.  There 
were also instabilities in the PBar source and the stack went down to 
~ 160 before they fixed it.  It's 172 now with the acc rate of +2 (which 
is at least positive!). 
 
<p> 
While the linac was being fixed, we took all calibrations, including 
laser.  We also took silicon calibrations twice: the first time 
errorneously (not enough time with HV on), and the second time after 
~1.5 hrs of cosmics (which should have been kosher).  However, the Si 
calibration batch job complained both times, so I'll follow it up with 
the Si calibration folks (Jason Nielsen et al.) later today.
