    <body>

    <h1>The Batch Module for Apache Tika</h1>

    <p>
        The batch module is new to Tika in 1.8.  The goal is to enable robust
        batch processing, with extensibility and logging.
    </p>
    <p>
        This module currently enables file system directory to directory processing.
        To build out other interfaces, follow the example of BasicTikaFSConsumer and
        extend FileResourceConsumer.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>NOTE: This package is new and experimental and is subject to suddenly change in the next release.</b>
    </p>
