===========================================================
Welcome to Apache Tika  <http://incubator.apache.org/tika/>
===========================================================

Apache Tika is a toolkit for detecting and extracting metadata and
structured text content from various documents using existing parser
libraries. 

Apache Tika is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Lucene PMC. Incubation is
required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates
that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have
stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.
While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness
or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be
fully endorsed by the ASF.

See http://incubator.apache.org/projects/tika.html for the current
incubation status of the Apache Tika project.
