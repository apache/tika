Apache Tika(TM) is a toolkit for detecting and extracting metadata and structured text content from various documents using existing parser libraries.

Tika is a project of the [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org).

Apache Tika, Tika, Apache, the Apache feather logo, and the Apache Tika project logo are trademarks of The Apache Software Foundation.

Getting Started
===============
Pre-built binaries of Apache Tika standalone applications are available
from https://tika.apache.org/download.html . Pre-built binaries of all the
Tika jars can be fetched from Maven Central or your favourite Maven mirror.

**Tika 1.X is scheduled for End of Life (EOL) on September 30, 2022.**  We will
continue to make security improvements until the EOL, but we do not plan to back port new functionality from the main/2.x branch. See [Migrating to 2.x](#migrating-to-2x) below for more details. 

Tika is based on **Java 8** and uses the [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org) build system. 
**N.B.** [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/personal) is required in the main/2.x branch to complete all unit tests. You can pass the `-DskipTests` flag if you wish to skip tests.

To build Tika from source, use the following command in the main directory:

    mvn clean install


The build consists of a number of components, including a standalone runnable jar that you can use to try out Tika features. You can run it like this:

    java -jar tika-app/target/tika-app-*.jar --help


To build a specific project (for example, tika-server-standard):

    mvn clean install -am -pl :tika-server-standard

If the ossindex-maven-plugin is causing the build to fail because a dependency
has now been discovered to have a vulnerability:

    mvn clean install -Dossindex.skip


Maven Dependencies
==================

Apache Tika provides *Bill of Material* (BOM) artifact to align Tika module versions and simplify version management.

If you use Apache Maven:

```xml
<project>
  <dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
      <dependency>
       <groupId>org.apache.tika</groupId>
       <artifactId>tika-bom</artifactId>
       <version>2.x.y</version>
       <type>pom</type>
       <scope>import</scope>
      </dependency>
    </dependencies>
  </dependencyManagement>

  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.tika</groupId>
      <artifactId>tika-parsers-standard-package</artifactId>
      <!-- version not required since BOM included -->
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</project>
```

For Gradle:

```kotlin
dependencies {
  implementation(platform("org.apache.tika:tika-bom:2.x.y"))

  // version not required since bom (platform in Gradle terms)
  implementation("org.apache.tika:tika-parsers-standard-package")
}
```

Migrating to 2.x
================
The initial 2.x release notes are available in the [archives](https://archive.apache.org/dist/tika/2.0.0/CHANGES-2.0.0.txt).

See our [wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TIKA/Migrating+to+Tika+2.0.0) for the latest.

Contributing via Github
=======================

Building from a Specific Tag
============================
Let's assume that you want to build the 1.22 tag:
```
0. Download and install hub.github.com
1. git clone https://github.com/apache/tika.git 
2. cd tika
3. git checkout 1.22
4. mvn clean install
```

If a new vulnerability has been discovered between the date of the 
tag and the date you are building the tag, you may need to build with:

```
4. mvn clean install -Dossindex.skip
```

If a local test is not working in your environment, please notify
 the project at dev@tika.apache.org. As an immediate workaround, 
 you can turn off individual tests with e.g.: 

```
4. mvn clean install -Dossindex.skip -Dtest=\!UnpackerResourceTest#testPDFImages
```

See <http://www.wassenaar.org/> for more information.

The U.S. Government Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), has classified this software as Export Commodity Control Number (ECCN) 5D002.C.1, which includes information security software using or performing cryptographic functions with asymmetric algorithms.  The form and manner of this Apache Software Foundation distribution makes it eligible for export under the License Exception ENC Technology Software Unrestricted (TSU) exception (see the BIS Export Administration Regulations, Section 740.13) for both object code and source code.

The following provides more details on the included cryptographic software:

Apache Tika uses the Bouncy Castle generic encryption libraries for extracting text content and metadata from encrypted PDF files.  See <http://www.bouncycastle.org/> for more details on Bouncy Castle.
