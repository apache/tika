# specifying other dists doesn't make sense because `trusty` doesn't have `oraclejdk8` (fails due to `Sorry, but JDK '[oraclejdk8]' is not known.`) which is the only supported JDK currently. Testing on Mac OSX doesn't make too much sense since it will run the same `maven` based build routine.

jdk:
- oraclejdk8
# `openjdk8` not available
- oraclejdk7
- openjdk7

install: /bin/true

script:
- mvn install --update-snapshots -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true --batch-mode --show-version && mvn test verify --batch-mode
