Our department will be migrated to Outlook in two groups.  The first group
will be migrated on Monday, June 11,  and the second group will be migrated
on Tuesday, June 12.   You will receive four e-mails from the Outlook
migration team.  Please do not delete them.  You will need to open the four
e-mails and follow the instructions to migrate to Outlook.

Assistants, you will be responsible for scheduling training for yourself and
your assignments.  It is recommended everyone attend a one hour training
class.  Training can be scheduled by contacting Maggie Cruz at extension
3-1816.  (Assistants, please coordinate training with your backup so both of
you are not in training at the same time.)  Outlook migration specialists
will be on the 38th floor to answer questions Tuesday and Wednesday, June 12
and 13.

Listed below is useful information provided to us by the Outlook Migration
team.

E-mail Policies

Users will be restricted to a Mailbox size of 100 MB.

Further mailbox size restrictions are detailed as follows:

Issue Warning at 75 MB - users are automatically sent a warning from the
System Administrator explaining they are near their Mailbox limit.

Prohibit Send at 100 MB - users are prevented from sending e-mail, yet they
can still receive internal and external messages.  Users must reduce the size
of their mailbox by deleting old mail, saving attachments to a local drive,
etc. before they can send e-mail again.

Inbound/Outbound Mail Size Limits - inbound and outbound e-mail messages will
be limited to a size of 10MB.

Deleted Item Retention - users will be able to recover deleted items from
their mailbox as old as 8 days.  Deleted items include e-mail messages,
folders, contacts, calendar entries, tasks, notes, journal entries and
meeting notices.

Archiving - archiving will not be a supported feature of Outlook 2000.

Migration Preparation

Clean Your Mailbox - due to new space limitations on your mailbox, you are
advised to clean your Notes mailbox of old, unneeded messages BEFORE
migration.  If you are at the 100MB limit on the day of migration, you will
not be able to send messages once you are in Outlook.

Limits on Items Migrated  - from the day of your migration, only 30 days of
old mail will be migrated from your mailbox.  This includes mail in your
inbox and other folders.  Calendar items dating back one year from the day of
migration will be migrated (with the exception of repeating appointments).
