= Using Tika as a Library (Java API)

This section covers using Apache Tika programmatically in your Java applications.

== Overview

Tika can be embedded directly into your Java applications as a library. This gives you
full control over parsing, detection, and configuration.

However, for most use cases we recommend using xref:../server/index.adoc[tika-server]
or xref:../grpc/index.adoc[tika-grpc] instead. See
xref:getting-started.adoc[Getting Started] for guidance on choosing the right approach.
