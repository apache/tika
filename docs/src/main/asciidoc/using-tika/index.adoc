= Getting Started with Apache Tika

Apache Tika can be used in several ways depending on your needs. Choose the approach
that best fits your use case.

== Choose Your Integration Method

link:java-api/index.html[Java API]::
Use Tika directly in your Java application. Best for tight integration and full control
over parsing behavior.

link:cli/index.html[Command Line (tika-app)]::
Run Tika from the command line. Best for quick extraction, scripting, and one-off tasks.

link:server/index.html[Server (REST API)]::
Run Tika as a standalone server with a REST API. Best for language-agnostic integration
and microservice architectures.

link:grpc/index.html[gRPC]::
Use Tika via gRPC protocol. Best for high-performance, cross-language communication.

== Which Should I Use?

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Use Case |Recommended Approach

|Java application needing content extraction
|Java API

|Shell scripts or batch processing
|Command Line

|Non-Java application (Python, Node.js, etc.)
|Server (REST) or gRPC

|High-throughput processing pipeline
|Server or gRPC with link:../pipes/index.html[Pipes]

|Quick one-time extraction
|Command Line
|===

== Scalable Processing

For processing large volumes of documents, see link:../pipes/index.html[Tika Pipes],
which provides fault-tolerant, scalable document processing and works with all of the
above integration methods.
