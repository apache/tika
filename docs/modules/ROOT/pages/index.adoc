= Apache Tika Documentation

WARNING: This reference guide was generated with the assistance of AI and requires
human review before it can be fully trusted. This documentation serves as an example
and a starting point, but more work remains. Contributions and corrections are welcome.

The Apache Tika toolkit detects and extracts metadata and text from over a thousand
different file types (such as PPT, XLS, and PDF). All of these file types can be parsed
through a single interface, making Tika useful for search engine indexing, content
analysis, translation, and much more.

== Features

* **Unified Interface** - Parse all supported file types through a single, consistent API
* **Broad Format Support** - Over 1,000 different file types supported
* **Metadata Extraction** - Automatically identify and extract document metadata
* **Text Extraction** - Pull readable content from complex file formats
* **Content Detection** - Identify file types regardless of file extension

== Getting Started

Use the navigation on the left to explore the documentation, or start with
xref:using-tika/index.adoc[Using Tika] to choose your integration method.

Apache Tika is an Apache Software Foundation project, formerly a subproject of Apache Lucene.
