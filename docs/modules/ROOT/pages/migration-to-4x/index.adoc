= Migrating to Tika 4.x

This section provides guides and background documentation for migrating to Apache Tika 4.x.

See the xref:roadmap.adoc[Roadmap] for version timelines and support schedules.

== Migration Guides

* xref:migration-to-4x/migrating-to-4x.adoc[Migration Guide] - Step-by-step guide for upgrading from Tika 3.x to 4.x
* xref:migration-to-4x/migrating-tika-server-4x.adoc[Tika Server Migration] - Breaking changes and new endpoints in tika-server 4.x
* xref:migration-to-4x/metadata-changes-4x.adoc[Metadata Changes] - Detailed metadata key changes and migration examples

== Background Documentation

* xref:migration-to-4x/design-notes-4x.adoc[Design Notes] - Architectural decisions and design rationale
* xref:migration-to-4x/serialization-4x.adoc[Serialization] - JSON serialization design and implementation details

== TODOs / Missing Features in 4.x

The following features from 3.x are not yet implemented in 4.x:

=== Config Serialization

The following tika-app options for dumping configuration are not yet available:

* `--dump-minimal-config` - Print minimal TikaConfig
* `--dump-current-config` - Print current TikaConfig
* `--dump-static-config` - Print static config
* `--dump-static-full-config` - Print static explicit config

These require completing the JSON serialization support for TikaConfig objects. The underlying serialization infrastructure exists (see xref:migration-to-4x/serialization-4x.adoc[Serialization]) but the CLI integration is pending.

*Workaround:* Manually create JSON config files using the templates in `tika-pipes/tika-async-cli/src/main/resources/config-template.json` as a starting point.
