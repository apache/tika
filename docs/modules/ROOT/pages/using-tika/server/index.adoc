= Tika Server

This section covers running Apache Tika as a REST server via `tika-server`.

== Overview

Tika Server provides a RESTful HTTP interface for parsing documents and extracting
content. It can be deployed as a standalone service or in a containerized environment.

== Basic Usage

[source,bash]
----
java -jar tika-server-standard.jar
----

The server starts on port 9998 by default.

== Topics

* xref:using-tika/server/tls.adoc[TLS/SSL Configuration] - Secure your server with TLS and mutual authentication

== Security Configuration

=== Config Endpoint Protection

By default, the `/config` endpoints that expose server configuration are disabled for security
reasons. These endpoints can reveal sensitive information about your server configuration,
including parser settings and system properties (see https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3271[CVE-2015-3271]).

The protected endpoints include:

* `/config` - Returns the server's full configuration
* `/config/parsers` - Returns configured parsers
* `/config/detectors` - Returns configured detectors
* `/config/mimeTypes` - Returns MIME type mappings

=== Enabling Config Endpoints

To enable these endpoints:

[source,json]
----
{
  "server": {
    "enableUnsecureFeatures": true
  }
}
----

WARNING: Only enable `enableUnsecureFeatures` if you have secured access to Tika Server through
network controls (firewalls, private subnets), a reverse proxy (nginx, Apache httpd), or
xref:using-tika/server/tls.adoc[2-way TLS authentication]. Exposing config endpoints to
untrusted networks can help attackers identify vulnerabilities and craft targeted attacks.

=== Command Line Usage

You can also enable unsecure features via command line:

[source,bash]
----
java -jar tika-server-standard.jar --enableUnsecureFeatures
----

=== Security Best Practices

1. **Keep config endpoints disabled** in production (default behavior)
2. **Use network controls** to restrict access to the Tika Server (firewall rules, private subnets)
3. **Consider TLS** for encrypted communication - see xref:using-tika/server/tls.adoc[TLS Configuration]
4. **Run with minimal privileges** - don't run Tika Server as root
5. **Monitor logs** for unusual access patterns
