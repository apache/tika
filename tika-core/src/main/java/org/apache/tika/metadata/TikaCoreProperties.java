/**
 * Contains a core set of basic Tika metadata properties, which all parsers
 *  will attempt to supply (where the file format permits). These are all
 *  defined in terms of other standard namespaces.
 *  
 * Users of Tika who wish to have consistent metadata across file formats
 *  can make use of these Properties, knowing that where present they will
 *  have consistent semantic meaning between different file formats. (No 
 *  matter if one file format calls it Title, another Long-Title and another
 *  Long-Name, if they all mean the same thing as defined by 
 *  {@link DublinCore#TITLE} then they will all be present as such)
 *
 * For now, most of these properties are composite ones including the deprecated
 *  non-prefixed String properties from the Metadata class. In Tika 2.0, most
 *  of these will revert back to simple assignments.
 * 
 * @since Apache Tika 1.2
