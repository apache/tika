// We should use the IANA registry for primary language names...see
// http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry
// There must be a package that uses this dataset to support knowledge of
// the default script, etc. And how to map from <lang>-<country> (e.g. 'zh-CN')
// to <sublang> ('cmn'), or <lang>-<sublang> to <sublan> ('zh-cmn' => 'cmn')
// We'd also want to know the default sublang for a macro language ('zh' => 'zh-cmn')
// There's also mapping 'zh-CN' to 'cmn-Hans' (simplified chinese script)

// TODO decide how deep to go into supporting extended language tags, see
// http://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/. For example,
// what should you expect from calling hasModel("en-GB") if there's only
// a model for "en"?

// This is mostly an issue for interpreting language tags in (X)HTML docs,
// and maybe XML if we really care. In those cases you could get something
// like "ast" (three letter language code), or even zh-cmn-Hant-SG
// (Chinese, Mandarin, Traditional script, in Singapore) plus additional:
// language-extlang-script-region-variant-extension-privateuse

// The full spec is at http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt
