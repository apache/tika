  Description: This test XML file is used to load two extra "custom" 
  mimetypes for unit testing
-->
<mime-info>
  <!-- A mimetype without any matching or globbing -->
  <mime-type type="hello/world" />

  <!-- A more complex mimetype, with a glob and a match -->
  <mime-type type="hello/world-file">
     <_comment>A "Hello World" file</_comment>
     <hello>world</hello>
     <glob pattern="*.hello.world" />
     <magic priority="50">
        <match value="Hello, World!" type="string" offset="0:13" />
     </magic>
     <sub-class-of type="hello/world" />
  </mime-type>

  <!-- This has the same match and priority, but different glob -->
  <!-- We can use the filename to identify the difference, see TIKA-1292 -->
  <mime-type type="hello/x-world-hello">
     <glob pattern="*.x-hello-world" />
     <magic priority="50">
        <match value="Hello, World!" type="string" offset="0:13" />
     </magic>
  </mime-type>

  <!-- add this to make testing with mock parser easier -->
  <mime-type type="application/mock+xml">
      <root-XML localName="mock"/>
      <sub-class-of type="application/xml"/>
  </mime-type>
</mime-info>
